## Reports Basic
This doc will help you understand the basic usage of reports and it's terminologies.

### Gross Revenue
Gross revenue reflects the amount customers actually paid after discounts. For example, if a product is `$100` but you offer a `$20` discount, the customer pays `$80`, and that `$80` is what contributes to your gross revenue. The original `$100` list price isn't counted in gross revenue because the discount was applied at checkout.
Please note, we are excluding the discounts from the gross revenue as well as from the net revenue.

### Net Revenue
Net revenue is the total amount of money your business earns after deducting all costs associated with delivering your products or services. This includes costs like shipping, and any other expenses directly related to fulfilling customer orders. For example, if you sell a product for `$100`, but it costs you `$30` to produce and ship it, your net revenue would be `$70`. You also have to deduct the refunds from the net revenue. If you had a `$10` refund, your net revenue would be `$60`.
