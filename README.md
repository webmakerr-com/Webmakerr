Welcome to the official GitHub repository of **FluentCart** – the performance-first, fully open-source eCommerce solution built exclusively for modern WordPress.

We're reimagining what WordPress eCommerce can be: blazing-fast checkouts, zero bloat, no transaction fees, and a clean, scalable foundation that grows with your business.

Legacy solutions slow down as you scale. FluentCart was built from scratch with a custom database schema, efficient queries, and modern architecture so your store stays lightning-fast – even with thousands of orders.

And now? **The entire codebase is open source under GPL** – because the future of WordPress eCommerce belongs to the community ❤️
